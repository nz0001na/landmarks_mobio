# TCDCN face alignment tool 
Matlab implementation of facial landmark detection by deep multi-task learning.

For a Win32 binary version (faster), please go to: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/TCDCN.html

Face alignment requires the bounding box from an external face detector. You may find a useful one from here: https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment.git


The provided tool is a re-implementation of the papers:
